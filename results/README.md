# Dataset Information

This project does **not** include raw datasets in the GitHub repository due to
file size and licensing restrictions.  
Instead, publicly available datasets are used and must be downloaded separately.

This document explains **which datasets were used**, **where to get them**, and
**how to place them correctly** to reproduce the experiments.

## 1. Lyrics Dataset (Bangla and English)

### Description
Song lyrics are used for the **Easy task** (Text VAE) and **Medium task & Hard task**
(Audio + Text Fusion).  
The datasets contain song lyrics in **Bangla** and **English**, stored in CSV format.

Each CSV file typically contains:
- Song title
- Artist name
- Lyrics text

### Source
These datasets were collected from publicly available Kaggle repositories.

Example sources:

- GTZAN on Kaggle
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andradaolteanu/gtzan-dataset-music-genre-classification
- Bangla song lyrics (Kaggle)
- English song lyrics (Kaggle)

> Note: Dataset links may change over time. Searching  
> **"Bangla song lyrics Kaggle"** or **"English song lyrics Kaggle"**
> will return equivalent datasets.

### Expected Location
After downloading, place the files here:

data/raw/
├── bangla_lyrics.csv
└── english_lyrics.csv

## 2. Audio Dataset (GTZAN Genre Collection)

### Description
The **GTZAN Genre Collection** is used for:
- Medium task (audio feature learning)
- Hard task (Beta-VAE with ground-truth genre evaluation)

- 10 music genres
- Each track is 30 seconds long

Genres:
- blues

### Expected Folder Structure
After extracting the dataset:

data/raw/gtzan/
├── blues/
├── classical/
├── country/
├── disco/
├── hiphop/

## 3. Why Datasets Are Not Included

- Audio files are **large**
- Kaggle and GTZAN datasets have **license restrictions**
- GitHub repository size limits

For these reasons, only **code and processed outputs** are shared.

---

## 4. Generated Data

All **processed features, latent representations, and visualizations**
are automatically saved during execution in the following folder:



results/


Examples:
- Latent vectors (*.npy)
- Trained models (*.pt)
- t-SNE plots (*.png)

These files can be regenerated by running the scripts in 'src/'.

## 5. Reproducibility Checklist

To reproduce all experiments:

1. Download the lyrics datasets (Bangla + English)
2. Download and extract GTZAN
3. Place datasets inside `data/raw/`
4. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   py -m pip install -r requirements.txt


Run training and evaluation scripts from src/

6. Notes

This project is intended for educational and research purposes.
